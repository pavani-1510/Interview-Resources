# 📄 **Interview Resources**

## 🚀 Where to Start

✅ **Step 1: Choose a Programming Language & Complete CodeChef Courses**

* Pick one programming language you’re comfortable with (e.g., **Python, Java, C++, or C**).
* Start with these foundational courses on CodeChef:

  * [Java Course](https://www.codechef.com/practice/java)
  * [Python Course](https://www.codechef.com/practice/python)
  * [C++ Course](https://www.codechef.com/practice/cpp)
  * [C Course](https://www.codechef.com/practice/c)

📌 *Note: Not all problems in these courses are free. Focus on solving the free ones first.*

After completing a basic course, practice with beginner-level problems:

* [500 Difficulty Questions](https://www.codechef.com/practice/basic-programming-concepts)

✅ **Step 2: Solve LeetCode Problems**

* Practice coding problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) regularly.
* 📌 *Sort the problems in increasing order of difficulty and solve them one by one.*
* ⏱️ *Set a maximum time limit of **20 minutes per problem**. If you cannot solve it within that time, study the solution and learn.*
