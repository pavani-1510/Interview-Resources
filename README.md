# Interview Resources

## Where to Start 🚀

✅ Step 1: Choose a Programming Language
Pick one programming language you’re comfortable with (e.g., Python, Java, or C++).

✅ Step 2: Complete CodeChef Courses
Start with these foundational courses on CodeChef:

[Java course](https://www.codechef.com/practice/java)
[Python course](
https://www.codechef.com/practice/python)

After 
[500 difficulty questions](https://www.codechef.com/practice/basic-programming-concepts)
=> Note that only 62% of problems are free.

✅ Step 3: Solve LeetCode Problems
Practice problems on LeetCode regularly.
📌 Sort the problems in increasing order of difficulty and solve them one by one.
📌 Set the maximum time limit to 20 mins.Refer solutions if unable to solve in 20 mins.

✅ Step 4: Learn DSA & Prepare for Placements
Once you’re comfortable with basic problem solving, move on to:

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) courses

Placement preparation courses


☺️ Keep practicing, stay consistent, and track your progress!
